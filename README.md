# Surfs Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analyis was to determine if a combination surf and ice cream shop would viable year round on Oahu.  Using SQLite and Pandas we were able to query weather data and produce summary statistics.

## Results
Below are three takeaways from the summary statistics for June and December, as well as images of the statistics themselves.

-- December had almost 200 fewer readings than June, though that may not be statistically significant.

-- The average temperature was about 3 degrees cooler in December.  

-- Standard Deviation for December was higher, indicating a wider swing of temperatures, which could mean a high     flucuation in sales during that time of year.

## Summary
Based on the data that was analyzed, it is probable that surf and ice cream shop could be financially viable.  Some more data analysis should be performed to see how other weather events might affect business.  Looking at precipitation in the current data would help determine if there are time of prolonged rain.  Additionally, data for severe weather events would be helpful to determine how many days the shop might need to be closed entirely.
