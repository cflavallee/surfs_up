# Surfs Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analyis was to determine if a combination surf and ice cream shop created by W. Avy would be viable year round on Oahu.  Using SQLite and Pandas we were able to query weather data and produce summary statistics for June and December.

## Results
Below are three takeaways from the summary statistics for June and December, as well as images of the statistics themselves.

- December had almost 200 fewer readings than June, though that may not be statistically significant given the overall number of readings.

- The average temperature was about 3 degrees cooler in December, which could be significant, but should not be too cold for ice cream or surfing.  

- Standard Deviation for December was higher, indicating a wider swing of temperatures, which could mean a high     flucuation in sales during that time of year.

## Summary
Based on the weather data that was analyzed, it is possible that a year round surf and ice cream shop would be financially viable.  Additional data analysis should be performed to see how other weather events might affect business.  It would also be beneficial to look at longer and varying spans of time to determine weather trends.  

A query that pulls precipitation information from the current data would help determine if there are times of prolonged rain that could hurt business.  Additionally, data and a query for severe weather events would be helpful to determine how many days the shop might need to be closed entirely. Depending on the results of additional analyis and barring any unusual weather, W. Avy could pursue their goal of a sustainable surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii.
